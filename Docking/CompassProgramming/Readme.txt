This example demonstrates how to customize which compasses are shown when dragging different RadPanes in the control.

When dragging a "Green" RadPane only the center compass over other "Green" RadPanes is shown and all of the root compasses.
When dragging a "Purple" RadPane all of the compasses (right, left, top, bottom and center) over other "Purple" RadPanes are shown and none of the root compasses.
