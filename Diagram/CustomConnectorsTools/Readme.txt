The Custom Connectors Tool Diagram SDK shows some possible ways to create Custom Connectors runtime.

	- the CustomConnectorAddTool allows you to add custom connectors by pressing Shift + Ctrl + MouseDown over a shape.
	- the CustomConnectionTool replaces the default ConnectionTool of the RadDiagram and allows you to define custom connectors on the intersection point between connection and shape. Simply create the connection with mouse and drop it over a shape (but not on a connector). This will create custom connector and attach the connection to it.

	- the SettingsPane in the demo provides a way to add custom Connector via additional custom made userControl placed in the second tab of the SettingsPane.
