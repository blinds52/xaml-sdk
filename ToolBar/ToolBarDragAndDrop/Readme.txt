The ToolBarDragAndDrop SDK demo for WPF shows integration between DragDropManager and RadToolBar / RadToolBarTray.
In this demo you are able to:

   - Reorder ToolBars in the same band (row) in ToolBarTray with Drag and Drop.
   - Move ToolBars in other bands within the same ToolbarTray with Drag and Drop.
   - Create new Bands (rows) in the current tray or other tray with Drag and Drop.
   - Drop a toolbar outside tray so that it can be dragged with Window around it (this is available only in the WPF demo).
