NOTE: This is a legacy sample for older versions. The current version of the TrackBall behavior makes between-chart syncing possible. Check out the TrackBallSyncedCharts sdk sample.
This sdk example demonstrates how to use annotations in order to achieve a TrackBall-Like effect. These annotaions can be synced between two or more charts and you can apply a custom behavior such as key navigation(left/right).
