This example demonstrates how you could implement a custom image format provider using a third party library*, which encodes/decodes different image types. 

* This software uses the FreeImage open source image library. See http://freeimage.sourceforge.net for details.
FreeImage is used under the FIPL, version 1.0. The full version of the license can be found at http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/freeimage-license.txt
